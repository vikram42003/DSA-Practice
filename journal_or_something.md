PRO TIP - IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELVES DUMBFOUNDED AT A PROBLEM, FIRST THINK HOW YOU'D GET THE ANSWER AS LIKE A HUMAN, NO CODE INVOLVED
THEN TURN THAT IDEA INTO SOMETHING CODEABLE, EVEN IF ITS HORRIBLY UNOPTIMIZED, THEN WRITE DOWN THE PSEUDOCODE FOR SOME OF THE APPROACHES
AND THEN MAKE CODE IT OUT IF YOU THINK ITS WORTH TRYING CAUSE AN UNOPTIMIZED SOLTUTION IS BETTER THAN NO SOLUTION
THEN LOOK AT THE CODE OR PSEUDOCODE FOR YOUR APPROACHES, TAKE BITS AND PIECES OF INFORMATION AND FACTS YOU'VE DISCOVERED UNTIL NOW
THEN CROSS OUT OR CHECK LIST DATASTRUCTURES OR ALGOS OR PATTERNS YOU THINK WOULD WORK/NOT WORK
GO STRAIGHT TO CODING IF YOURE THAT MUCH CONFIDENT IN A SOLUTION
OR TRY OUT ONE OF THOSE APPROACHES ON A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES, THINK OF EDGE CASES IF IT WORKS ON THOSE EXAMPLES
AND THEN CODE IT OUT !
