    # Quick Selection Approach - Time = Î˜(n) and O(n^2) - Space = O(1) - TLE!!! (need to partition into 3 for it to work within time limit)

    # Here we use the concept used in selection part of selection sort
    # Also, here we'll sort the list in ascending order
    # We need to find the kth largest element, if we sort the list in ascending order, thats the (len(nums) - k) element from the right
    # We take a pivot (rightmost element in this case) and the sort the list according to that
    # iterate from left -> if nums[i] < pivot then swap it with index j and increment j, if nums[i] > pivot then leave it alone
    # after iterating swap pivot with nums[j], now EVERY ELEMENT to the left of nums[j] is smaller than it, and every element to
    # its right is bigger than it, in other words we can say that it is GUARENTEED that nums[j] is at its correct position
    # Now if j == k then we've found the element, if j < k then we need to do this same operation to the left of the list, otherwise
    # we need to do it to the right of the list
    # do that until j == k and we would have found the kth largest element

    # NOTE - if the array is already in ascending order like - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then the time complexity of the algorithm will
    # be n^2 cause we'll have to eliminate the rightmost element one by one while checking each element (n - eliminated elementes) times
    # BUT in average case it'll be O(n) cause on average we'll sort roughly half the list, elminate either left or right half, sort it again
    # and then eliminate the other half again and again until we find the kth element. So time complexity will be n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ...
    # and so on and that is mathematically equal to 2n
